BotSpeak is a robotics programming language designed to bridge the gap
between small embedded systems such as the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and Arduino.

Below are directions on how to setup the BotSpeak interpreter as well as grammar
rules and coding examples. See https://sites.google.com/site/botspeak/ for more info.

To get the BotSpeak interpreter working on a Raspberry Pi you need the Parsimonious Parser
installed on your Raspberry Pi. The Parsimonious parser is included in this repository, or
alternatively you can download it here: https://github.com/erikrose/parsimonious.

To install Parsimonious: 
1) Open up your terminal and navigate to the botspeak_pi/ directory
2) unzip parsimonious-master.zip
3) cd parsimonious-maser/
4) sudo python setup.py
5) That's it!
